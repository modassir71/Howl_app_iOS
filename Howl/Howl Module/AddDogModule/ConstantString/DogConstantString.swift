The app will only actually track you when you tell it to.  We wont be asking you to setup an account or sending you any advertisments through the apps core functionality.  The safety of you and your beloved dog are our primary concern.  Each walk will generate a unique code which you’ll need to share with your chosen contact each time\n\nIn order for HOWL to work, your emergency contact must follow the link you send to them on each occasion, allowing them to recieve status updates you send\n\nPlease spend a few minutes setting up HOWL so it’s ready for your first walk"
